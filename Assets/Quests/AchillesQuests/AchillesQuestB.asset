  questTitle: 'Play Music for the Harvest Festival at Heldom Dam

'
  questDescription: "\u201CThe Harvest festival at Heldom Dam is a big deal\u2013literally.
    The whole celebration takes place right on the dam itself. It\u2019s scenic,
    festive, and mildly terrifying if you don\u2019t like heights. The villagers
    are counting on someone being there to keep the music lively and the dancers
    from thinking about the \u2018bottomless abyss\u2019 part of the venue. Be sure
    not to drop your instrument over the edge!\r\n"
