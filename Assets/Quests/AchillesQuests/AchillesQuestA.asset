  questTitle: "Play Music for the Harvest Festival at Lindinburrow\r"
  questDescription: "\u201CThe folks at Lindinburrow have been working hard all season,
    and now it\u2019s time to celebrate with food, dancing, and some much-needed
    fiddle solos. The only problem? Their regular bard caught a nasty case of hay
    fever. Grab an instrument and bring some much-needed tunes to the festival before
    the locals start trying to clap in unison. Nobody wants that. We promise a basket
    of assorted pies made by our very own Ms. Mauta!\u201D\r\n"
