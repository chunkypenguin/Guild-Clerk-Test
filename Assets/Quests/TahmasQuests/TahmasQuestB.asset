  questTitle: "Retrieve retired Captain, Nuubaan Sparlar\u2019s, long sword from
    the sunken ship wreck"
  questDescription: "\u201CI would love to retrieve it myself, however if I did that
    I would have to spend more time away from my wife than I would like. I have been
    thinking about how to do both but I can't bring myself to spend too much time
    away from home. If someone happens to be passing by the bottom of the ocean,
    keep your eyes out for my sword. It might be in bad shape but it did a fine job
    when I needed it. Whatever you can retrieve, I will be more than happy to compensate
    an adventurer for it.\u201D"
